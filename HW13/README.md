The Application I choose to demonstrate an example of race condition is Instagram.

One situation where Race Conditions can occur is due to concurrent interactions of users on same post.
For example,
- User A reacts (likes, loves, etc.) to a post.
- User B unreacts (unlikes, removes reaction) from the same post almost simultaneously.

Explanation of the Race Condition:
In a thread-unsafe implementation, a race condition can occur when two threads representing actions by different users simultaneously access and modify the reactions_count of the same post. Without proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, the threads might interfere with each other's operations, leading to incorrect likes count.

For example:

Thread 1 increments the reactions_count by 1 (from 0 to 1) as User A reacts to the post.
Almost concurrently, Thread 2 decrements the reactions_count by 1 (from 1 to 0) as User B unreacts from the same post.
As a result, the final count of reactions may not accurately represent the actions of both users due to the concurrency issue, leading to inconsistencies in the data.

Thread-Safe Version:
The thread-safe version incorporates proper synchronization mechanisms like locks to ensure that only one thread can modify the reactions_count at a time. This will prevent concurrent conflicting operations on shared data, thereby avoiding race conditions and ensuring the correctness of reaction counts in such scenarios.
